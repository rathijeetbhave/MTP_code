   test performance when allotting

Number of committees (being read from csv file...): 20

Building weights matrix: rows = 148 and columns 160

Total number of students allotted *some* committee =  148 - 19
Number students getting 3rd or worse choices = 2

Number of students not allotted any committee = 19
